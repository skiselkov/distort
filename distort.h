 * Applies distortion to an input buffer. The buffer is replaced by the

 * or cached data in the `dis' state object, the buffer will have silence
 * prepended to it to avoid outputting undistorted audio.
 *
 * Argument description:
 *
 * `dis': distortion control object previously created using distort_init().
 * `samples': an array of 16-bit signed PCM samples (single channel only!).
 * `num_samples': number of samples contained in `samples'.
 * `amplify': voice signal amplification level. You can pass 1.0 in here
 *	to not have the signal amplified at all, or a value less than 1.0
 *	to suppress the signal. This is not applied to the background noise
 *	generator, so you simulate a fading volume on the signal portion
 *	while keeping the noise volume constant.
 * `noise_level': background noise level from 0.0 to 1.0 (nothing but noise
 *	in the output). Typical values would be 0.02 for little background
 *	noise, 0.2 for moderate background noise, to 0.6 for heavy background
 *	noise (makes transmission almost unreadable).
